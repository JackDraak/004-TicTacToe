Here are some components that could be refined:

1. Error handling: Add more comprehensive error handling and input validation throughout the code to make it more robust, especially in user input-related functions such as ask_for_move in the Human class.

2. Code comments: While many parts of the code are well-commented, some functions could use more detailed explanations to describe their purpose, the parameters they accept, and the values they return. This would make the code even easier to understand and maintain.

3. AI_ML_template class: The AI_ML_template class is currently a placeholder for future machine learning-based AI players. Fleshing out this class with specific implementations, such as AI_ML_SVM, AI_ML_NN, or AI_ML_RL, would improve the functionality of the project.

4. Unit tests: Adding unit tests for the various classes and functions would help ensure the code is working correctly and make it easier to identify any issues that arise when making changes to the code.

5. Optimization: Some parts of the code, such as the AI_MCTS implementation, could potentially be optimized for better performance or more efficient resource usage. This might include tweaking the exploration_param or max_iterations values, or optimizing the tree traversal and selection process.

By refining these components, the project would become even more robust, easier to maintain, and potentially more efficient.
